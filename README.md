# next-i18next

**This project is a work in progress**.

It aims to eventually be a simple solution for adding [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) translation to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects, while fully supporting SSR, multiple namespaces with codesplitting, etc. The groundwork has been laid in the [react-i18next example here](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next/tree/master/example/nextjs).

You can see the [roadmap for initial release here](https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next/milestone/1).
